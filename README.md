Auto EDA with DataPrep Library


If you are belonging to the field of machine learning then you hear the word EDA which means Exploratory Data Analysis.  Let us discuss a brief on exploratory data analysis then we move forward, EDA is a subset of machine learning, where it is an approach for the data analysis that employs a variety of techniques to maximize insight into a data set and graphically performing numerous amounts of operation.

In any machine learning project life cycle, you know that the first step is Exploratory Data Analysis. We perform EDA on our dataset then calculate the fundamental calculation from the data using graphs and plots. Mostly, we use python language for coding scripts of machine learning and there is a huge number of libraries available for performing exploratory data analysis, some of the most used libraries are matplotlib, pyplot, bokeh, seaborn, etc…  but these libraries are having lots of fundamental functions which we can’t remember at the time of scriptwriting, and when we execute their codes then it will take lots of time to show output.

What we will do for reducing this time? It is such a big issue regarding this. Don’t worry! Python is updating day by day, A group of data scientist has developed a beautiful library which reduces the amount of time we investing in exploratory data analysis.

## DataPrep Introduction

As the name suggests DataPrep, the preparation of data. The DataPrep is developed by a group of SFU data science researchers to speed up data science operations. it helps us to simplify the EDA operations in little bit lines of code it means that we don’t need to write lots of stuff code apart from that we only need to write one or two lines of code and EDA will perform.
This DataPrep library helps us to do two main important tasks one is it collects data from a common data source and second is we can able to perform exploratory data analysis easily. We need to use dataprep.eda module to perform EDA operations. if you don’t know what the dataprep.eda is? it is the fastest and easiest EDA performing library, it allows to understand dataframe in few lines of code.
